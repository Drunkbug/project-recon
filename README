Project Recon

This data analysis report for project Recon, to collect the data, I used Recon on 
IOS10 for over one week and executed them at least 3-5 minutes everyday.

====================================================================
Task1:
I edited mitm2log.py and let it read file path as input,
then execute all the *.dump file under that directory, and returns
the accumulated contacted domain list.
To find the identities of each contanted domain, I created domain_analysis.py, which 
uses socket and whatis command to find identities in the contacted domain list. 
apps_count.py is used to count number of sites contacted by each app.

Questions:
How many sites are contacted by each app that you use?
By using scripts I mentioned above, I got a list of app - #sites map:
    TencentQQ: 89
    Weibo: 1
    Icloud: 67
    GitHub: 1
    Adobe: 17
    Apple: 736 
    Twitter: 1
    Amazon: 163 
    Google: 1160
    Taobao: 4
    Akamai: 498 
    Facebook: 267 
    Yahoo!: 8

Does that traffic seem legitimate?
Yes, most of the traffic are the apps/websites I used during the week. Since I used
iphone for testing, there are many traffic goes through Apple, such as App store and 
IMessage. Also during the peroid I used goole and gmail frequently. 
It is not surprised that most of the traffic were from Apple and Google.

Is there anything surprising in your data?
I'm pretty surprised that Akamai provided a large amount of traffic during the 
test. It seems Akamai provided a lot of CDN service and traffic.

====================================================================
Task2:
I modified the regex in egrep and grep and added regex format of my password, then I
added usernames, IMEs of my phones and my phone number. 
I found my TencentQQ username was leaked several times. Which is one of my important
personal identity, if the account acquied by any malicious user, I could receive
spam message and acquire personal information by others easily.
